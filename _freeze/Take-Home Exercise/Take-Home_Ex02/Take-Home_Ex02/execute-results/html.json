Each visualisation will be critique and redesigned. The assessment will be based on the framework from [DataRemixed.com](https://dataremixed.com/2012/05/data-visualization-clarity-or-aesthetics/), which evaluates visualisations along two primary dimensions: clarity and aesthetics.\n\n![](images/clipboard-891094182.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"550\"}\n\n## 3.1 Overall Exports and Imports of Services, 2020 - 2024\n\n![](images/clipboard-4104274913.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"550\"}\n\n### 3.1.1 Critique - Quadrant IV: Confusing yet Beautiful\n\n✅ The y-axis starts at 0, which makes it easier to gauge and assess the data's scale.\n\n✅ Subtle gridlines were used, which is less distracting for the viewer.\n\n❌ Using dollar bill icons to represent data in the bar chart adds visual confusion as we may interpret each icon representing a specific value.\n\n❌ Alternating exports and imports makes it difficult to visually track the growth trends of each category independently, thus disrupting the understanding of CAGR for exports and imports as there is no continuous visual path that readers can follow easily.\n\n❌ The CAGR figures are positioned away from the main chart and are represented in a separate element at the bottom, which may cause viewers to overlook these figures or fail to connect them with the corresponding data in the chart.\n\n❌ The visualisation contains too much information such as yearly totals, individual exports and imports and trade balance. This might overwhelm the viewer, especially when trying to extract specific insights quickly.\n\n❌ The visualisation lacks a lead-in paragraph that could set the context, making it difficult to immediately understand the message the visualisation.\n\n### 3.1.2 Proposed Data Visualisation Makeover\n\nThe image below presents a general mock-up of the proposed data visualization makeover, accompanied by an explanation of the thought process behind the suggested changes.\n\n![](images/clipboard-4108250707.png)\n\n### 3.1.3 Revised Data Visualisation\n\n## 3.2 Total Merchandise Trade At Current Prices, 2020 - 2024\n\n![](images/clipboard-1781260504.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"550\"}\n\n### 3.2.1 Critique - Quadrant IV: Confusing yet Beautiful\n\n✅ Elements are well-aligned and spaced effectively.\n\n✅ Bars are represented as a single shipping container instead of disjointed units like the dollar bills in Section 3.1, making it easier to interpret values.\n\n❌ The visualisation aims to present the total merchandise trade, yet it splits the data into separate bars for exports and imports. This division makes it misleading as readers may focus on the differences between exports and imports rather than on the aggregate trade figures. It also makes it harder to quickly assess the overall trade performance year-on-year.\n\n❌ Tick marks were omitted from the x-axis despite the value of merchandise trade being a continuous variable. This makes it difficult to interpret the scale of the data and estimate values.\n\n❌ The years are not labeled directly on the y-axis or associated clearly with the corresponding data bars (which are in various hues of colour, adding more visual confusion). Instead, they are indicated in separate text boxes that state the total merchandise trade for each year. The disjointed presentation can confuse readers as it requires them to match the data visually across different parts of the chart.\n\n❌ The % increase in merchandise trade in 2024 is placed separately at the bottom of the chart, detached from the visual data representation. Furthermore, the total trade values for each year are in separate text boxes and does not visually represent the percentage growth. Readers would not be able to intuitively interpret the growth rate without doing mental calculations.\n\n### 3.2.2 Proposed Data Visualisation Makeover\n\nThe image below presents a general mock-up of the proposed data visualization makeover, accompanied by an explanation of the thought process behind the suggested changes.\n\n![](images/clipboard-329651265.png)\n\n### 3.2.3 Revised Data Visualisation\n\n## 3.3 Non-Oil Domestic Exports By Major Commodity Sections, 2024\n\n![](images/clipboard-75365197.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"550\"}\n\n### 3.3.1 Critique - Quadrant III: Ugly and Confusing\n\n✅ Elements are well-aligned and spaced effectively.\n\n❌ The visualisation uses a stacked bar chart, which is typically meant for displaying proportional contributions. However, the data seems to focus on absolute values as they are displayed in a larger font size as compared to the percentages. This suggests a greater importance on actual values over relative proportions.\n\n❌ The segments within the stacked bar chart are not arranged in descending order of value, making it challenging to quickly assess which sectors are more significant based on size.\n\n❌ The visualisation highlights the top three commodities based on the text box at the bottom. However, presenting the data via a stacked bar chart makes it difficult for viewers to quickly identify the top 3 commodities.\n\n❌ The labels for the respective commodities do not follow the visual order of the segments in the stacked bar chart (e.g. ***Beverages*** suddenly presented after ***Miscellaneous Manufactured Articles***), increasing cognitive load required to interpret the chart as viewers naturally expect the top-most label to correspond to the top-most segment in the chart, and so forth down the line.\n\n### 3.3.2 Proposed Data Visualisation Makeover\n\nThe image below presents a general mock-up of the proposed data visualization makeover, accompanied by an explanation of the thought process behind the suggested changes.\n\n![](images/clipboard-2865888173.png)\n\n### 3.3.3 Revised Data Visualisation\n\n# 6.0 References\n\nKam, T.
