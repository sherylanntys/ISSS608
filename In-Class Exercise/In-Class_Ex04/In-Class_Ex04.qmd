# 1.0 Getting Started

## 1.1 Installing and Launching the R Packages

```{r}
pacman::p_load(haven, SmartEDA, tidyverse, tidymodels, ggplot2)
```

## 1.2 Importing Data

The code chunk below uses read_csv( ) to import exam_data.csv into R and save it into a tibble data frame:

```{r}
exam <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

# 2.0 Visualising the Distribution of English Scores

```{r}
ggplot(exam, 
       aes(x = ENGLISH, # As English is plotted on the x-axis, we will obtain a horizontal boxplot.
           y = CLASS)) +
geom_boxplot()
```

Boxplots show the summary statistics and not really the distribution. Which is why we use the ridgeline plot, which explicitly shows the distribution.
